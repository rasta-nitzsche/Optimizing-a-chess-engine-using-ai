Optimizing a chess engine using AI : implementation of Minmax algorithm and dealing with the horizon effect through quiesence search.

## Implementation of minmax algorithm
In general, in a game implementing the MinMax algorithm, a tree is used to represent positions and moves. The nodes represent a configuration and the root the current configuration. Thus we can evaluate according to the rules of the game if a sheet wins, loses or draws.

## Horizon effect
One of the inconvenients of MinMax is that it cannot handle all the search space because the generated tree is extremely large. For comparison, the size of the tree generated by a chess game is 10^40 . One solution is to stop generating the tree at a fixed depth 'd', and use an evaluation function to estimate configurations 'd' moves ahead of the current config.
This algorithm is considered weak and can be circumvented easily by a player: indeed, it is limited only to a certain horizon to make its final decision which would be the equivalent of a human player who did not envisage that his opponent can sacrifice an important piece to put him in check.
The objective of this part is therefore to deal with this problem by relying on tests showing the veracity of our solution.

## Solution
We have implemented the quiescence search algorithm. The latter consists in taking only the stable nodes: if after a depth 'd', a leaf is not stable, we generate the successors (not all because the algorithm would take too much time) and we take the stable leaves, otherwise we repeat until stable.

- **Our stability condition:** a configuration is stable if and only if the king of the current player is not threatened and has not captured an opponent's piece. During our resolution of the TP and our research carried out, we noted that there is another position which is not considered stable and which is the “promotion”. The Promotion of a pawn consists in replacing it immediately by another piece when it arrives on the last row. However, we did not take this case into consideration during the solution because it never appears during a duel between 2 computers.
- **Our condition for generation of successors under quiescence:** when the leaf is not stable, we generate a successor if and only if: it has not already been visited, if its father has failed or if there is a capture.
